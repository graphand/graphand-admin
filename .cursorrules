Graphand is a serverless SaaS framework that provides a fully managed backend for building and deploying cloud applications quickly.
It integrates tools such as databases, APIs, cloud functions, and storage in one scalable platform.
Its aim is to streamline development by eliminating infrastructure hassles and ensuring secure, reliable deployments.

This codebase is the admin panel for graphand users.
It helps them manage their projects, subscriptions, organizations, collaborators, and more.

It is built with Next.js and app router, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
Forms are handled with react-hook-form and zod.
All the Graphand integration is made with the Graphand client (@graphand/client) and the Graphand core (@graphand/core).
It also uses react-query for data fetching.
State management is done with zustand.

If you need to install a new package, use pnpm instead of npm.
You must never update components created by shadcn (src/components/ui).
Before writing code that needs data, check the graphand docs to know how to use the client to get the data you need.
Before creating any component, check the shadcn docs to know if a component already exists. (or in the components/ui folder to know if it already exists)

- Client-side authentication state is stored in cookies using AuthStorage adapter
